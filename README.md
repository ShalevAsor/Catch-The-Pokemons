# Catch the Pokemons

**Catch the Pokemons** is a game designed to demonstrate various graph implementations, including both weighted and unweighted graphs. The game uses graph algorithms to create an engaging experience where agents capture Pok√©mon through a series of levels.

## Graph Implementation

The project features a directed weighted graph (DWG) implementation that supports:
- **Low Complexity:** Efficiently handles large-scale graphs.
- **High Capacity:** Supports up to one million vertices and ten million edges.
- **Algorithm Support:** Includes algorithms like Dijkstra's and BFS.
- **JSON Compatibility:** Save and load graphs in JSON format.

### Graph Types

- **Directed Weighted Graph (DWG):** Each edge has a direction and weight, which impacts the shortest path calculations.
- **Directed vs. Undirected Graphs:** Directed graphs have edges with specific directions, whereas undirected graphs do not.

## Algorithms

- **BFS (Breadth-First Search):** Used to determine if the graph is strongly connected.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Computes the shortest path distance between two nodes.

### Strongly Connected Graphs

A strongly connected graph has a path between each pair of nodes. For more information, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component).

### Shortest Path

- **Shortest Path Distance:** Returns the minimal distance between two nodes.
- **Shortest Path:** Returns the list of nodes representing the shortest path.

## Catch the Pokemons Game

The game consists of 24 levels, each with agents and Pok√©mon. The agents must catch Pok√©mon using graph algorithms.

### Game Mechanics

- **Levels:** 24 different levels with increasing difficulty.
- **Agents:** Utilize graph traversal algorithms to capture Pok√©mon.
- **Pok√©mon Types:**
  - **Positive Pok√©mon:** Located where the source node is greater than the destination node.
  - **Negative Pok√©mon:** Located where the source node is less than the destination node.
