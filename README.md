## What is directed weighted graph? <br>
simple graph made up of vetices and edges. <br>
the difference btween simple unweighted graph to weighted graph <br>
is that each edge on a weight graph has weight wich is a positive number. <br>
the difference between directed graph to simple undirected graph is that <br>
each edge in direceted graph has a direction. <br>
edge between node 1 and node 2 is NOT equals to edge between node 2 to node 1. <br>

## the benefits of using my dwg:
- Low Complexity
- Support more than one mil verteices and ten mil edges
- each public class has tests
- support algorithms like Dijkstra's and Bfs
